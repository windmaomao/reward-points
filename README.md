# Reward points

## Getting Started

First install with `npm install`. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## File Structure

The api is installed at `src/pages/api/rewards` where the most testing are performed since I believe this is the project is about.

The only component is installed at `src/components/`. The only page is through `src/pages/index.js`
