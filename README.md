# Reward points

## Getting Started

First install with `npm install`. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

To test with `npm test`.

## File Structure

The app is built with NextJS setup which is entirely based on the ReactJS. The only difference is that there's an API route.

The api is installed at `src/pages/api/rewards` where the most testing are performed since I believe this is the project is about. You can reach this api via [rewards](http://localhost:3000/api/rewards).

The only component is installed at `src/components/`. The only page is through `src/pages/index.js`.
